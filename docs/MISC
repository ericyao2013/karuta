## Multiple blocking insns can be in a state.

Use sub-state machine

if (s1 == INITIAL) {
  if (canStart1()) {
    do it;
    s1 = WAITING;
  }
} else if (s1 == WAITING) {
  if (done1()) {
    s1 = DONE;
  }
}

if (s1 == DONE || done1()) && (s2 == DONE || done2()) .. (sn == DONE || done_n())
  s = next;
  s1 = INITIAL
